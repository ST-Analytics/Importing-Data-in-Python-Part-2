#Now you have the Twitter data in a list of dictionaries, tweets_data, where each dictionary corresponds to a single tweet.
#Next, you're going to extract the text and language of each tweet. The text in a tweet, t1, is stored as the value t1['text'];
#similarly, the language is stored in t1['lang']. Your task is to build a DataFrame in which each row is a tweet and the columns
#are 'text' and 'lang'.

# Import package
import pandas as pd

# Build DataFrame of tweet texts and languages
df = pd.DataFrame(tweets_data, columns=['text', 'lang'])

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
